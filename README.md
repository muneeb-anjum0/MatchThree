## Overview

**Match-Three** is a classic tile-matching puzzle game built in C++ using the SFML library. The game features a polished UI, smooth animations, sound effects, and multiple game modes. Players swap adjacent tiles to match three or more of the same type, earning points and progressing through levels.

	- Normal mode with progressive levels  
	- Timed mode with countdown timer

- **Animated Tile Swaps:**  
	- Smooth transitions and easing for tile movements

- **Progress Bars:**  
	- Track collection of different species with animated progress bars

- **Sound & Music:**  
	- Background music for menus and gameplay  
	- Sound effects for clicks, matches, invalid moves, navigation, level up, and game over

- **Help & Instructions:**  
	- In-game help screen with rules and instructions

## Technologies & Libraries

### Programming Language

- **C++17**  
	- Modern C++ features for performance and maintainability

### Graphics & Audio

- **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**  
	- `Graphics`: Rendering windows, sprites, textures, and text  
	- `Audio`: Playing music and sound effects  
	- `Window`: Handling events and user input  
	- `System`: Timing, clocks, and utility functions

	*SFML is used extensively for all rendering, input, and multimedia needs. See [`dependencies.h`](dependencies.h) for all SFML includes.*

### Build System

- **Makefile**  
	- Custom Makefile for Windows (MinGW)  
	- Handles compilation, linking, cleaning, and running the game

- **Batch Script**  
	- `build_and_run.bat` for easy build and launch via double-click

- **VS Code Tasks**  
	- Integrated build tasks for compiling with g++ via MSYS2

### Asset Management

- **Custom Asset Folders**  
	- Organized structure for textures, audio, and fonts

### Other Libraries

- **Standard C++ Libraries**  
	- `<cmath>`, `<iostream>`, `<time.h>`, etc.

### Prerequisites

- **Windows OS**
- **MinGW/MSYS2** (g++ compiler)
- **SFML 2.x** (pre-built binaries and headers)

### Steps

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
	- Download as zip or use `git clone https://github.com/muneeb-anjum0/Match-Three.git`
2. **Install SFML:**
	- Download and build SFML for Windows. Place the `include` and `lib` folders as referenced in the Makefile.
3. **Build the Game:**
	- Double-click `build_and_run.bat`  
	- Or open a terminal in the project folder and run:
	  ```powershell
	  make clean; make; make run
	  ```
4. **Run the Executable:**
	- The game will launch as `game-normal.exe` in the project root.

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure all required DLLs (SFML, GCC, etc.) are present in the root directory.
- If you encounter missing DLL errors, copy the relevant files from your SFML and MinGW installation.
